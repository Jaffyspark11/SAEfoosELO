need to make it possible to update with 1v1s and 2v2s maybe even 2v1s

1v1s

-pretty easy just use the one from class
-in sheets, have options for team a and b, player 1 and 2 for each team
-if 1v1, only put name in player 1 slot, if p2 empty, we know they played alone
-check if OFF and DEF column is the same


DEF, OFF, and 1V1 ratings

Have a DEF and OFF column for team Y and team P





-can use google sheets to make it easy for anyone to update, we can pull the data from sheets into pandas df
-check if player played with partner, if so take average elo of both and put it against average evo of other team
-









make the script run every time a new game is added so it updates realtime
